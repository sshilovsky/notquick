Notquick - notmuch GUI client written in C++/Qt/QML.

Notquick is free software, released under the GNU General Public License
version 3 (or later).

Status: work-in-progress. Few useful things are implemented, the repo is actually my backup atm.

Feature wishlist
----------------
* full libnotmuch support
* webkit-based html message viewer
* highly-customizable with qml and/or custom configs UI
* vim-like keyboard control

Notquick is not responsible for fetching, sending and bulk initial tagging
mail. It uses external tools for that.

Building
--------

    qmake && make

Running
-------
$MAILDIR should contain a path to existing notmuch mail database. If not set,
$HOME/mail is used.

Contributing
------------
Looking for designers familiar with either QML or SVG.
